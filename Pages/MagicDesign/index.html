                  I wanted depth without complexity: draw a shape, it becomes a solid you fight with. The hard part was turning messy line strokes into clean polygons robustly and efficiently.

                <div class='section-description'>
                    Seven years ago I tried to build my first custom Magic set. I’d been reading Mark Rosewater’s articles on card and set design, so I set myself the very ambitious target of ~300 cards and spent five months filling it out one card at a time.

                <div class="divider"></div>
                <div class='section-description'>
                    The result looked fine on the surface. Each color had a creature group—white soldiers, blue wizards, black faeries, red goblins, green elves—and each did the “obvious” thing for that color: wizards drew cards, goblins multiplied, elves buffed each other. But when I playtested it, the same pattern appeared in every deck: pick a creature type, collect as many of it as possible, and win.

                <div class='section-description'>
                    In other words, I’d flattened Magic’s most flexible tool, the color pie, into five near-identical linear strategies and generic-feeling factions. That’s when it clicked for me that good game design is about making mechanics that talk to each other meaningfully. Like any tool, a great game mechanic or system is only as good as what one uses it to create.

                <div class='section-description'>
                    You can see what I was trying to do in an official set like Bloomburrow. Its frog cards—e.g. Lilysplash Mentor and Pond Prophet—combine blue’s planning with green’s creature base to reward players not only for collecting more frogs, but for assembling a small engine of frogs that enhance each other. It’s a strong faction identity bolstered by compelling mechanics. That was missing from my set.

                    Going into my next set, I made a rule for myself: don’t just assign tribes to colors; give each archetype a distinct play pattern and at least one synergy hook that isn’t “play more of me.”

                <div class="divider"></div>
                <div class='section-description'>
                    My second large Magic project is a 540-card cube — a custom draft environment where every card is effectively the same rarity. I started it about three years after finishing my first set, and in that time I’d gotten better at limited, better at balance, and had done enough other design work to know what I wanted to fix.
                </div>
                <div class="divider"></div>
                <div class='section-description'>
                    The biggest change was starting with archetypes. In my first set I mapped colors to single, linear tribes. This time I built around the 10 two-color pairs, the way many official sets do, because I’d seen how much more mechanical and narrative depth that structure gives.
                </div>
                <div class="divider"></div>
                <div class='section-description'>
                    The challenge was to make each archetype feel distinct but still share enough cards to draft smoothly. For example, I knew my red–black deck would be about sacrificing creatures for value, so I made red–green about generating lots of small creatures—which conveniently become sacrifice fodder. That meant red could contain cards that lived in both archetypes. I repeated that logic across the color pairs so every color could “point” in more than one direction.
                </div>
                <div class="divider"></div>
                <div class='section-description'>
                    I also chose a bottom-up approach to setting. Because this cube was meant to explore archetype structure more than worldbuilding, I let the mechanics lead. I finished the cards first and only later thought about flavor text and art.

                <div class='section-description'>
                Unlike my first set (which lived in Google Docs and improvised printouts), this cube was built in Magic Set Editor from day one. MSE’s built-in charts let me track things like color balance, mana curve, removal density, and creature/spell ratios. That let me be scientific about changes: after a draft where players said “removal feels weak,” I could check the actual removal count and see whether it was truly low or whether we’d just had an odd draft. And when I buffed it, I could immediately see how that affected the overall makeup of the cube.
